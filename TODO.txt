- Breakout Board
  - Use keyed ribbon cable connector for debug probe
    - Check layout of pins! Don't repeat previous mistakes :)
  - Add registration holes for a 3d-printed shroud for positioning the sensor
  - Silkscreen for approximate sensor outline
  - Add a through-hole resistor (And diode?) and button/switch for charging, and discharging, the capacitor
    - Diode pointing from external power to Vcap (Need to draw out the circuit to check if it would work)
  - Add breakout for measuring current on sensor without capacitor populated
  - Add breakout for easier cap voltage measuring
  - Reset button
- Sensor
  - Use proper energy harvesting IC
  - Breakout current measuring pins
    - Maybe use one of those cut-away fuse thingies, so by default it's just shorted
